# Quarn Quiz
An app that exams your quarn memorization.\
However it is not listening to you, but it takes an exams from the number of the verse\
Which means a random verse will come up and you have to type in the correct verse number and surah.

# TODO:
1. Adding Verse Page Design
2. Exam Page Design
3. Connect to database and create the tables
4. Add functionality to Adding Verse Page
5. Add functionality to Exam Page (which just checks if you answered correctly or not), at least that's for now.
